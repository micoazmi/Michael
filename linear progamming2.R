#A manufacturing company makes two models A and B of a product. Each piece of Model A
#requires 9 labour hours for fabricating and 1 labour hour for finishing. Each piece of Model B
#requires 12 labour hours for fabricating and 3 labour hours for finishing. For fabricating and
#finishing, the maximum labour hours available are 180 and 30 respectively. The company makes
#a profit of Rs 8000 on each piece of model A and Rs 12000 on each piece of Model B. How many
#pieces of Model A and Model B should be manufactured per week to realise a maximum profit?
#What is the maximum profit per week?
